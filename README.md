# Binary Tree Algorithm

![BST_columns](./assets/BST_columns.png "Binary Search Tree columns")

While working on this algorithm, I decided to try writing some OOP-style code. But I still maintained a functional way of writing, without mutating variables inside class methods.

features:

- the `has()` method checks whether the binary tree contains a value.
- the `getColumn()` method returns only those values that belong to the given column.
- the `traverse()` method returns values based on the selected strategy: DFS (inorder, preorder, postorder) and BFS (breadth-first)
